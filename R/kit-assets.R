# version was a hardcoded "0.2.0" for this entire session, never once bumped across any of the many rebuilds
# of www/cd-react/cd-react.js this session made (Sidebar's flyout nesting fix, FieldNumber's mount signal and
# blur-flush fix, FieldSelect, DownloadButtonStatus, ...). htmltools serves a dependency's files at a URL keyed
# by name+version, so an unchanging version means an unchanging URL -- and an unchanging URL is exactly what a
# browser's own HTTP cache keys on, regardless of how many times the R process itself gets restarted (a server
# restart does nothing to a browser's already-cached copy of a file it thinks it already has at that URL). This
# is the same class of bug styles.css/fonts.css's own "?v=" query param (app.R) already guards against, just
# for a dependency that doesn't have a query string of its own to bust -- the version string is the only lever
# htmlDependency() gives for this, so the bundle's own mtime becomes an extra version component here.

# for Sidebar.tsx, cd_download_button_server() for DownloadButtonStatus.tsx) -- resolving it here, once, means
# neither component has to guess at weight or the exact glyph class name (aliases resolve too: "check-circle"
# -> "circle-check") the way a hardcoded "fa fa-<name>" class used to (see Sidebar.tsx's own history: the bare
# .fa class is Font Awesome 6's SOLID weight regardless of icon name, so every icon that used it rendered
