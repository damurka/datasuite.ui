# rebuilt every time a landing-page Edit link jumps back into it post-Finish, wizard_panels.R): once=TRUE
# means it only ever reacts to the FIRST mount a given call site ever sees, silently discarding every later
# one, so a value pushed on a later remount (cd_set_file_upload()/cd_update_input()) never lands. The underlying
# input[[paste0(id, "__mounted")]] itself already carries a fresh, distinct value (Date.now(), {priority:
# "event"}) on every single mount -- FileUploadZone.tsx/FieldNumber.tsx/etc.'s own mount effect sends it
# unconditionally, not just once (see their own comments) -- so reading it straight through, with no coercion
# to a sticky boolean, is enough on its own: req()/observeEvent() on the result re-fires each time it changes.
