# cd_nav_item(); the header crumb/actions outputs don't depend on anything reactive, so those two render once
# as before. The sidebar nav (Phase 9, sidebar locking) is the one exception: `data_ready`, a reactive(logical)
# from app.R (the exact same "cache() exists AND cache()$countdown_data exists" condition every page module's
# own `active = page_is(...)` already gates its real computation on -- see page_is()'s own comment in app.R for
# why that reads `countdown_data`, not `quality_confirmed`) -- so every item except Introduction/Load Data
# (nav.ts's own ALWAYS_UNLOCKED_TABS) locks until a dataset has actually finished loading, and unlocks live the
# moment it has, without a page reload. `analysis_ready`: a second, stricter reactive(logical) -- explicit user
# request, "if data is not adjusted it cannot generate analysis" -- for whichever items cd_nav_item() marked
# `requires_adjustment = TRUE` (Denominators and Analysis, app.R's own cd_nav_sections); everything else
# (Data Quality/Remove Years/Data Adjustment itself) still only needs `data_ready`, so the user can actually
# reach the page that performs the adjustment. Defaults to `data_ready` so a caller that never adjusts data at
# all (none currently do) doesn't have to pass a second, identical reactive just to satisfy this parameter.
